Internal Links: Verify that there are sufficient links to other pages on the same website. Highlight the words where the links are added.

Keyphrase in Introduction: Confirm the keyphrase appears naturally in the first paragraph.

Keyphrase Distribution: Ensure the keyphrase is evenly distributed across the content.

Keyphrase Length: Validate the keyphrase length is appropriate (not too long or short).

Meta Description Length: Check that the meta description is under 155 characters.

Keyphrase in Subheadings: Ensure the keyphrase is included in at least one H2 or H3 subheading.

Keyphrase in Slug: Check that the page slug (URL) naturally includes the keyphrase.

Dynamic Output Formatting:

For passed items, display a green check icon (✅) with a positive message (e.g., "Good job!" or "Well done!").

For failed items, display a red cross icon (❌) and use GPT to generate a personalized recommendation.

GPT Recommendations:

For failed checks, provide tailored recommendations based on the user's keyphrase and the webpage's context. Example:

GPT Recommendation: "Add the keyphrase naturally to your meta description. For example: 'Learn everything about [keyphrase] in this guide to [topic].'"

Start with a summary indicating the number of passed checks (✅) and failed checks (❌).

List each item with its result and recommendation (if applicable). 

Implementation Notes:

For recommendations, add a "copy" button for the user to easily copy paste the text.

Ensure the tool is beginner-friendly, with clear explanations and actionable feedback.
